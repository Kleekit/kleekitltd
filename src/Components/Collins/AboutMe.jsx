      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am an Enthusiastic, Inquisitive person, to say the least, who got into
        web development with the desire to turn passion into a long-term career.
        The idea of being able to create an interactive and user-friendly
        experience has always been exciting to me.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I eagerly embrace challenges and seek areas for improving my creativity,
        problem-solving, and skills as a web developer.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am keen on building connections with individuals who are willing to
        take advantage of opportunities in developing solutions that will
        positively impact society and have a good time while doing it.
        <br />
        Because What’s the Point If We Can’t Have Fun?
