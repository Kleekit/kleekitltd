      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a Believer and this makes me a game changer. I believe in Christ
        Jesus. I believe Frontend Development is a craft and it should be done
        well. I believe that life is a gift.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        When cooking, people use pot and ingredients. I use my IDE and
        technologies like React js, Nextjs, JavaScript, TypeScript, Node js and
        lots more.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Trust that I am a good chef. I don't just cook components for
        responsiveness, I also cook for cross browser compatability.
      </p>
    </div>
