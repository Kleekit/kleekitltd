      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination, my love for
        mobile applications got me into this awesome relationship of creating
        quality, adaptive and functional applications.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am familiar with the entire mobile application development process and
        I understand that is takes more than just writing codes to create a
        definitive, user friendly and high functioning application.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I am readily available for tasks that will enhance my creative mind and
        problem solving skills as a developer.
      </p>
