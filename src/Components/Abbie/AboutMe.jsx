      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I am a fervent believer in human-centered design and am passionate about
        solving human problems, user interfaces, and user satisfaction. As an
        empathic designer, I focus on understanding people's deepest needs,
        frustrations, and desires. To provide solutions that enrich people's
        lives with a comprehensive approach.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have worked on projects in user experience, web design, web app
        design, mobile app design, and branding. I enjoy collaborating,
        experimenting with analog and digital technologies, learning new things
        and approaches, and improving my design process.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have significant experience working in startups and fast-moving teams
        with fixed deadlines. I have the flexibility to use different
        technologies and methodologies to learn new situations and adapt
        quickly.
