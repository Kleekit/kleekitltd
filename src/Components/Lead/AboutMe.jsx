      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm Emmanuel, I'm not a full stack developer but I can translate figma
        markup to pixel-perfect React components, and manage an app state with
        Redux toolkit.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Behind the scene, I can build RESTful APIs with Nest.js and Express.js
        with privilege/authorization, and persist data with Nosql/ Mysql.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Also, I know some DevOps but I can't brag about it for now. Maybe when I
        have spent a reasonable amount of time troubleshooting a yaml file.
      </p>
    </div>
