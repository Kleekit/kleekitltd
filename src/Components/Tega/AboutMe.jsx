      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p>
        I love creating fun, interactive user friendly designs (Mobile Applications) and my
          passion is for everything Front-End. I focus on writing clean, efficient, reusable code.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        I have built some applications enough to say that I'm very confident with my skills. 
        I follow best practices and the specifications of my organisation. 
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Working with a team is something that I enjoy and I get my code review
        from the project managers to improve my code quality.
      </p>
